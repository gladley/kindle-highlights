QR codes are a very basic way to give a physical device a digital identity. These are two-dimensional barcodes, which can be read by any imaging device able to extract the data encoded in the image, such as a smartphone. Like read-only RFID tags, QR codes rely on the code being mapped to more extensive product information in a database.

You go out in public, even with a group of friends, and everyone’s eyes are glued to their phone screens. We have such severe cases of FOMO (fear of missing out) that we tend to ignore and miss the moments and opportunities that are right in front of us. From text messages and Instagram to email and push notifications for apps, there is always someone or something competing for your attention. To find a balance between being connected and using your time constructively, you need to establish boundaries so there is a clearly defined separation between the two. When you’re creating boundaries, think about your goals; this could help you determine the times and terms for when you use your device and when you don’t.

The term ‘critical design’ was coined by Anthony Dunne (1997), and it describes a form of practice that he and Fiona Raby developed as research fellows with colleagues at the Royal College of Art (RCA), London, in the early 1990s. Critical design is located outside terms set by capital or production and counters conventions of utility, technology, and fiscal gain. Produced for exhibit rather than sale, these designs are less about problem solving and more about problem finding within disciplinary and societal discourse.

“Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that waned with the advent of industrial society–but this is misleading. Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself.

The final book in the project returns to more certain terrain, the earth itself. In both natural resources and climate change, we are facing a physical crisis largely of our own human making. The myth of Pandora has become now a secular symbol of self-destruction. To deal with this physical crisis we are obliged to change both the things we make and how we use them. We will need to learn different ways of making buildings and transport and to contrive rituals that accustom us to saving. We will need to become good craftsmen of the environment.

The word sustainable is now used to convey this kind of craftsmanship, and it carries a particular baggage. Sustainable suggests living more at one with nature, as Martin Heidegger imagined in his old age, establishing an equilibrium between ourselves and the resources of the earth–an image of balance and reconciliation. In my view, this is an inadequate, insufficient view of environmental craft; to change both productive procedures and rituals of use requires a more radical self-critique. A stronger jolt to changing how we have used resources would come in imagining ourselves to be like immigrants thrust by chance or fate onto a territory not our own, foreigners in a place we cannot command as our own.

Such a product fulfills the manufacturer’s desires and some of the customers’ expectations as well.

Since 1987 we have been studying various products from major manufacturers, ordinary things such as a computer mouse, an electric shaver, a popular handheld video game, a hair dryer, and a portable CD player. We found that during use they all off-gassed teratogenic and/or carcinogenic compounds—substances known to have a role in causing birth defects and cancer. An electric hand mixer emitted chemical gases that got trapped in the oily butter molecules of the cake batter and ended up in the cake. So be careful—you might unintentionally be eating your appliances.

One of the ways to attract your target audience is website search engine optimization (SEO). First, you will have to work out the right keywords for your product. Then you’ll have to periodically post useful content on news portals, blogs, social networks, and directories, with backlinks to your website and perform other actions that will help build your website ranking. If you appear higher on search engines, more people will visit your website.

One of the parts of SEO is to constantly create relevant content by using important keywords. In order to evaluate whether this method suits you, I suggest conducting an experiment. By using Google, try to find an article on the topic of your project. If articles in the first page of results are short and non-informative, and the design of the website has not changed since the 2000s, that is a good opportunity for you to shine. Write an article that is a few times better, more informative, has text that reflects today’s issues, and add some graphics. You do not need to write the content yourself; you can just create the structure, specify the sources of information, and give this job to a copywriter.

Another way is to share it on social networks, such as LinkedIn, as it allows you to post articles or content sharing platforms (e.g. Medium). Whatever option you choose, it is important to leave a link to your site in the article so that interested people would be redirected to your landing page and Google’s algorithm would index the backlink.

Run a few A/B tests with different versions of your landing page and see which one converts better. Then, for a week or two, drive some traffic to your site by running highly targeted Facebook ads. Some website visitors will sign up and their contact details will automatically go to your mailing list. Once you have at least a few hundred leads, you can send them an email by saying that they can be the first to pre-order your product. Point them to your website with a simulated checkout process. Before visitors enter their credit card details, they should see a message like this: “You are too late—products are out of stock.”

After evaluating the statistics of various Kickstarter projects, it can be assumed that about 2–3% of the gathered potential backers will back your project if you have a good product/market fit and you were able to reach your target audience.

“Lead ads” means that a person who finds the ad relevant can leave their contact details (usually name and email or just email address) directly in Facebook after clicking an ad. It’s a great option for a few reasons. First, you may generate leads without having a landing page that takes time and effort to build. Second, the price per lead may be lower because a person who’s interested in the ad doesn’t need to leave Facebook.

First, leads were collected with the goal of testing Facebook ads and evaluating the price per lead. There was no email sequence, so those leads didn’t receive any welcome email. As a result, over time they became “colder” and may have forgotten that they had subscribed. The second reason was the wrong target audience.

Every journalist or blogger is always looking for news on their target topics, expert insights, research, and other information, so they can write the next interesting article. HARO (Help A Reporter) was created exactly for this purpose and it connects professionals and specialists (sources) with journalists.

you use HARO or hashtags, your contact with media begins only when your product and expertise matches a journalist’s request. This might suit for a long-term strategy, but it is not effective in crowdfunding pre-launch, as you are short on time and your topic may never show up, or the article will interest very few people who will not have influence on the campaign. So I suggest trying out an alternative—directly contacting journalists, bloggers, or influential people who are relevant to your topic.

First of all, you have to analyze successful campaigns similar to yours (see the chapter “Analysis of similar campaigns”). Having found relevant articles that cover stories related to those campaigns, identify the author of these articles. Most often you’ll find the journalist’s full name at the top or at the end of the article. Create a list of such contacts—if the content isn’t too old, they are likely to be interested in the niche of your project.

I suggest having at least 200 contacts relevant to your project’s area. From a longlist, you should also be able to pick your top 20 shortlist of journalists. You should give more attention to the shortlist (follow them on social media, comment on their articles, try different methods to get in touch) and automate your outreach for the longlist.

The main advantage of the biggest media outlets with a high rating (Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Business Insider, BBC, Forbes, etc.) is that they attract massive traffic and reach a large audience. Also, when they post an article, it soon appears on many smaller blogs, which aggregate relevant information and share it with their readers. So if you’re able to get attention of a journalist from The New York Times, Mashable, or TechCrunch, you may not even need to contact the rest—the news will spread on its own.

When I interviewed Gediminas, he told me that he did not even network with journalists in advance. Instead, he spent that time building a list of relevant journalists and creating personalized letters. Once the Rubbee campaign was launched on Kickstarter, he sent those personalized pitches to journalists from his list and told them that they would be the first to have written about Rubbee.

Unfortunately, not all of us have the money to hire a professional PR firm. In this case, entrepreneurs who don’t have enough money and don’t want to build a media list and contact them one by one, try to look for other alternatives. And sometimes they find press release distribution platforms, such as PRLog.org, PR.com, PR-Inside.com, Newswire.com, OnlinePRNews.com, PRNewswire.com, PRWeb.com, and BusinessWire.com. Such platforms can be free or paid, and prices vary from $99 to $1000 (when choosing the best plan). Here, you can send your message to tens or hundreds of portals in one shot.

What many haven’t seen are the Vita Vibe MP12 ultra-light mini-parallettes that are small enough to fit in carry-on luggage.

At the same time, we should avoid discussing at the dinner table with our child why they should eat something. Fish is good for your brain...You need the potatoes for energy... Peppers are full of vitamin C. Children absolutely should learn about healthy eating and the different food groups and nutrients that their body needs – but the dinner table is not the time for a lesson. They are very unlikely to be receptive to it when they are ‘in the moment’ of that meal. It only adds to the pressure and gives them more to rebel against. Would you want a lesson on why getting a good night’s sleep is important when you’re settling down to sleep? Do talk to your children about healthy eating, but do it away from the table.

TIPS: Stick to a once-a-week ‘Sweets day’ (see here). •Don’t always have pudding or end meals on a sweet note. •Give children peanut butter, yeast extract, cream cheese or something else savoury on toast and in sandwiches – not jam, treacle or chocolate spread. •Don’t buy sugar-coated cereals like frosted flakes or chocolate-flavoured ones. Stick to regular cornflakes, plain wheat-based cereals, instant oats or porridge. •Give children a savoury snack like a cracker with cheese, rather than reaching for a biscuit or chocolate bar – even if it’s a bit more trouble to prepare. •Offer a bread roll as a snack when you’re in the supermarket (see here). •If there’s a choice of plain or sweet (e.g. rice cakes, popcorn) buy the plain. •Don’t have a ‘goodies cupboard’ or tin in your house full of sweets and chocolate that your child will constantly hanker after!

The idea behind the STM, as it became known, was very simple. A blind person can “see” someone’s face simply by running a finger over it and building up a picture in their mind. The STM works in a similar way. The difference is that the “finger” is a finger of metal, a tiny stylus reminiscent of an old-fashioned gramophone needle. By dragging the needle across the surface of a material and feeding its up-and-down motion into a computer, it is possible to build up a detailed picture of the undulations of the atomic terrain.

The basic elements of a conventional computer are transistors. These have two distinct voltage states, one of which is used to represent the binary digit, or bit, “0”, the other to represent a “1.” A row of such zeros and ones can represent a large number, which in the computer can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided by another large number.1 But in a quantum computer the basic elements—which may be single atoms—can be in a superposition of states. In other words, they can represent a zero and a one simultaneously. To distinguish them from normal bits, physicists

To build the perfect sprint team, first you’re going to need a Danny Ocean: someone with authority to make decisions. That person is the Decider, a role so important we went ahead and capitalized it. The Decider is the official decision-maker for the project. At many startups we work with, it’s a founder or CEO. At bigger companies, it might be a VP, a product manager, or another team leader. These Deciders generally understand the problem in depth, and they often have strong opinions and criteria to help find the right solution.

2017 study from Cornerstone Capital Group[3] predicted that up to 7.5 million existing retail jobs are at risk over the next decade from automation.  High Profile Retail Retail is very relatable for most people - it’s very visible; it touches on society, jobs, property, leisure, basic needs, transport/logistics, entrepreneurship, payments and myriad other aspects of economic activity and living. Most of us interact with retail in some form every day. It already provides good examples of early applications of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, Voice Recognition and more. It’s also a confluence point for both online and offline examples of high-tech developments that raise several ethical questions, especially relating to jobs and privacy. Major retailers have played an outsize role in the stock market for decades, but incumbents can’t expect to stay successful by going about business as usual. Retail has become a very public battleground for the world’s leading technology companies trying to innovate their way to a position of dominance in consumers’ daily lives. As both Alphabet and Amazon’s market value exceeds one trillion dollars, they have the R&D funds to experiment with countless innovations simultaneously and we’ll refer to them frequently throughout this book. For Google, any shift away from web-based shopping, to voice-led or subscriptions, could severely impact its bottom line, given its dependence on advertising. Amazon, the world’s most high-profile e-commerce company, as you’ll see in the many examples throughout this book, is innovating and experimenting, having invested over the last two decades to build a dominant platform. Continuum of Change It’s important to note that the term “retail” covers a broad, sometimes barely related set of experiences. Picking a $2 jar off a shelf in a discount grocer is a far cry from having a personal shopper escort you around a luxury showroom looking at $1,000 handbags, yet both are technically considered retail. So “retail” isn't a singular thing and different sectors will have different priorities and will move at different paces. You will see from the impacts discussed here, some innovations are clearly more focused on selling convenience than luxury, while others obviously make more sense when deployed in an elongated, high-cost purchase journey. Even within the same sector, you’ll see variations in approach, outlook, and speed of adoption. In many sections in this book, you’ll see possibilities to take a cautious approach or a more ambitious adoption of new trends and technologies. For

Millennials demand the convenience of omnichannel accessibility during their shopping journey, which challenges retailers to have an integrated experience that can effortlessly transition their consumer data from their smartphone, to laptop, to local store, and back again. Improving the payment experience through self-checkout kiosks and advanced digital payment technologies is essential to keeping the Millennial shopper. They use multiple devices to make purchases and have started turning their mobile device into a handheld wallet, replacing cash, printed receipts and plastic loyalty cards. Shopping Millennials expect a customer-centric experience in which they feel valued. Showing interest in these shoppers creates loyalty - whether it is in-store or through social media channels. In order to do this, retailers need to closely examine what they’re currently doing with customer data - this can include where customers shopped last, what was purchased, and their preferences - and ensure this information is being utilized to deliver a more personalized shopping experience. It has been suggested that Generation Y individuals put little effort, emotions and time into low-involvement decisions, such as the choice of electricity or home insurance supplier, but a lot of effort, energy and emotions into high-involvement decisions[14].

Although it’s been a staple of marketing for a couple of decades now for brands and retailers, looking at consumers through the lens of “generations” is likely to go out of fashion as technology now enables far more granular targeting - and consumers expect better than generic assumptions about their requirements.

In today’s digital landscape, consumer patience for “lip-service purpose” is non-existent. Accenture Strategy’s most recent global survey[24] of nearly 30,000 consumers in 35 countries—including more than 2,000 consumers in the United States—found that 62% of them want companies to take a stand on current and broadly relevant issues such as sustainability, transparency and fair employment practices.

Jane McDaid, founder of Irish youth marketing agency THINKHOUSE, says she sees businesses who are fundamentally rethinking how they do things so as to be more responsible and sustainable[27]: “I think the days of ‘greenwashing’ are over – young people are far too smart and when they witness greenwashing, they’re motivated to call it out which ends up being a huge embarrassment to brands/organizations. Brands know that younger consumers are voting with their wallets and they are supporting brands and businesses that are truly aligned with their values.”

Discuss top priorities: What are the one, two, or three most critical outcomes for your report and how can you help her tackle these challenges? Calibrate what “great” looks like: Do you have a shared vision of what you’re working toward? Are you in sync about goals or expectations? Share feedback: What feedback can you give that will help your report, and what can your report tell you that will make you more effective as a manager? Reflect on how things are going: Once in a while, it’s useful to zoom out and talk about your report’s general state of mind—how is he feeling on the whole? What’s making him satisfied or dissatisfied? Have any of his goals changed? What has he learned recently and what does he want to learn going forward?

Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch argues that protecting low performers only increases the damage when, inevitably, a manager is forced to let them go. “What I think is brutal and ‘false kindness’7 is keeping people around who aren’t going to grow and prosper.

Never tell your child they’re a fussy eater – or let them hear you telling anyone else! If you do, they are more likely to continue to conform to that label.

Eating is the one area where children soon learn that it’s easy for them to have a lot of power: superpower in fact! By rejecting certain foods or insisting on others they can control us emotionally and physically. One Yuck! could make us cross.

How many days would it have taken of just giving this boy his lunch to reverse the situation? Maybe two or three. Four maximum. It wouldn’t take long for him to realise there was much more pleasure to be got from eating his lunch if there was no power or attention to be gained from not eating it.

Knowing: an insight, a spark, a concept—simply a starting point. For example, you intellectually know how to launch a million-dollar business, drop on a wave to surf, or communicate with confidence. Doing: the chasm of endless reps, practice, challenges, and adversity. This is where you put all your knowing into practice—and it’s hard. It’s supposed to be. Most people quit here before they get anywhere near the next phase. Being: where the magic happens. You are no longer the logical concept. It’s who you are. It’s being on the wave and not thinking because you’ve transcended it. It’s the way you walk into a room or hold space in a conversation. This is where flow states happen.

At the end of the year, I was exposed to a powerful text that shifted the way I view work, life, and business. This book was Deep Work by Cal Newport (Newport 2016), an accomplished professor, writer, and researcher who seems to accomplish more than anyone in his field. He used examples of those who took deep work to the extreme and extracted themselves from society, including Carl Jung, Benjamin Franklin, and others. I was floored by the distinctions in the book and realized how much I’d been letting the monkey mind control my life.

The more I engaged in these undistracted sessions, the less I felt the need to check the smartphone or e-mail.

One of the most powerful tools I’ve ever encountered for extreme levels of focus is known as the Pomodoro technique. The technique was made famous by Francesco Cirilo and is based on performing 25 minutes of completely undistracted work, followed by a 5-minute break. This would be “one” Pomodoro. After doing four cycles, you’d take a 15 to 20-minute break. It seems way too simple to most people when they read it, or I teach it. However, for these 25 minutes, you’re zeroed in on one task. No e-mail, no social media, no phone, no text, no conversations—nothing but the work in front of you.

THE DAILY QUESTION When you wake up in the morning through your 90-day experience with the big rocks, review your vision from the top, all the way down. This may take you 30 minutes or 3. What matters is the level of your intention behind it, not the duration. After you’ve reviewed your vision, you ask yourself the question we revealed in chapter 8: What can I execute on right now that will prove that my outcome and vision are not only possible, but coming true?

If things are complex and require endless planning, blueprints, and meetings, then we can avoid the work today and put if off until tomorrow, next week, or next quarter. This is why companies will spend millions of dollars on strategic retreats and create beautiful binders which end up sitting on the shelf. It’s why the solopreneur focuses on small, insignificant tasks. It’s why we constantly feel we need a little more time and planning.

When you and I compare ourselves to others, we have two choices. The first option: Stay stuck, let ourselves off the hook, and be disempowered. It’s easy to see someone else’s success and think, “Well, if they’re so far along, why even bother?” We see their success as unattainable and create a narrative around why we’re not good enough or capable of getting that far.

It is one of the most important of all questions for achieving personal effectiveness. What can you and only you do that if done well can make a real difference? This is something that only you can do. If you don’t do it, it won’t be done by someone else. But if you do do it, and you do it well, it can really make a difference to your life and your career.

EAT THAT FROG! 1. Review your list of tasks, activities, and projects regularly. Continually ask yourself, “Which one project or activity, if I did it in an excellent and timely fashion, would have the greatest positive consequences in my work or personal life?” 2. Determine the most important thing you could be doing every hour of every day, and then discipline yourself to work continually on the most valuable use of your time. What is this for you right now? Whatever it is that can help you the most, set it as a goal, make a plan to achieve it, and go to work on your plan immediately. Remember the wonderful words of Goethe: “Only engage, and the mind grows heated. Begin it, and the work will be completed.”

EAT THAT FROG! 1. Practice “zero-based thinking” in every part of your life. Ask yourself continually, “If I were not doing this already, knowing what I now know, would I start doing it again today?” If it is something you would not start again today, knowing what you now know, it is a prime candidate for abandonment or creative procrastination. 2. Examine each of your personal and work activities and evaluate it based on your current situation. Select at least one activity to abandon immediately or at least deliberately put off until your more important goals have been achieved.

Because the guts for the all the phones were identical, the engineering manager I spoke with realized that he could save Motorola a ton of money by building just one version of the base of the flip phone. This base would be paired to either the Talkabout top or the Timeport top. The base remained the same, but the top changed. It had one body with a number of different heads, which is why I call this a Frankenstein approach to product design. And, like Frankenstein the monster, some of the phones looked a bit off: The head didn't fit the body.

When customers first encounter your product, service, or experience, they will size it up first for its aesthetic attractiveness. Do they find it beautiful, sophisticated, cute, novel, or serious in the way it looks or feels? This is not an exhaustive list, but the point here is that the aesthetic attributes of a product matter in the way that we perceive it.

The secret is to establish core design values in your organization that are nonnegotiable priorities and embed them in the corporate culture. To achieve this, you must acquire design taste, hire the right design talent, and then weave these design values and culture into the fabric of the organization. In addition, there must be a person who functions as the arbiter of taste and who maintains the design standards and values.

Every manager is under pressure and timeline demands to rush out mediocre products like the Newton. Development teams will often acquiesce to a “good enough” product because there is money to be made (at least in the short term) with “good enough.” Great is so often the enemy of good. Great costs more and requires more energy and effort. A company can subsist on good enough products. But in the long run, “good enough” will damage everything: your products and your brand and eventually your company, which will also be perceived as just good enough rather than great.

When it comes to burnout there is often little opportunity for proper recovery. Instead, the pressures of the job feel overwhelming and relentless and we have insufficient time to recuperate. At best, this can leave you feeling as though you are ‘running on fumes’; never really fully yourself. At worst, you can feel always on the brink of tears, while conversely cut off from emotional connection with your friends and family, with little time, interest or energy for personal interests. Burnout is also linked to an increased risk of depression.
